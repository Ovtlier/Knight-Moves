# Knight-Moves
Knight Moves Visualiser using JavaFX. 

openjfx is provided for convenience (it is a moderately large folder 50-100mb)

Knight-Moves.sh can take 1 argument (a path to openjfx lib folder) and no argument assumes you have cloned the given openjfx for convenience.
It will then run Knight-Moves.jar.
